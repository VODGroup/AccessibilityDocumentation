        Simplifies interactions with a complex element for VoiceOver.

            By default any element can contains ``Book/accessibilityValue`` to expose additional data for user. Some elements come complicated and can contain dynamic value, controlled by vertical swipe. Examples:
        }
        
        @Steps {
            @Step {
                Accessible element can be marked by ``UIAccessibilityTraits_/adjustable`` trait to make ``Book/accessibilityValue`` dynamic. 
                
                @Code(name: "", file: "AdjustableTutorialStep_1")
            }
            
            @Step {
                Accessible element can be marked by ``UIAccessibilityTraits_/adjustable`` trait to make ``Book/accessibilityValue`` dynamic. 
                
                @Code(name: "", file: "AdjustableTutorialStep_2")
            }
            
            @Step {`
                As a result the element will react on vertical swipe by calling ``Book/accessibilityIncrement()`` and ``Book/accessibilityDecrement()``. 
                
                @Code(name: "", file: "AdjustableTutorialStep_3")
            }
            
            @Step {
                After each swipe the ``Book/accessibilityValue`` getter will be reread and the new value will be spoken out.
                
                @Code(name: "", file: "AdjustableTutorialStep_3")

            Voice Control and Switch Control don't fit to adjustable elements and works best like separate buttons.

                > Important: Adjustable elements is useful only for VoiceOver and will brake behaviour for Voice Control and Switch Control. 
                
                Distinguish behaviour in code by dynamic getter:
