# [AccessibilityDocumentation](https://vodgroup.github.io/AccessibilityDocumentation/documentation/accessibilitydocumentation/)

## What is this?
At the moment this project is a vague prototype of **wrapping the already-existing documentation of [Accessibility features available in iOS SDK](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/accessibility)** in a way **to make it easier to research** available in a form of a **web-resource**. In other words our goal is to find a solution for **making plain documentation more entertaining and requiring nothing more than a web-browser**.

Generally the project is dedicated to those who use the mentioned instrumentality in their work: **software developers** and **product designers**. 

Currently our goal is to try out variable methods of documentation wrapping by implementing various **interactive solutions**, such as **step-by-step guides**, wide range of **media types** used and **[VoiceOver Designer](https://github.com/VODGroup/VoiceOverDesigner)** app prototype in order to find the most efficient educational methods. 

## Why make it a website? 
Websites is an exemplary **cross-platform** solution. Having resources available on the Net widens its **accessibility**.  

## How does it function?
The project itself is a [Swift Package](https://www.swift.org/packages/) that contains a [DocC](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/docc) file out of which the website is built. 
The deployement is implemented by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
