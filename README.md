# [iOS Accessibility Handbook](https://vodgroup.github.io/AccessibilityDocumentation/documentation/iosaccessibilityhandbook/)


## — What is this?
This repository is the source code of [**iOS Accessibility Handbook**](https://vodgroup.github.io/AccessibilityDocumentation/documentation/iosaccessibilityhandbook) online documentation, which is an **educational resource** dedicated to help **developers**, **designers**, **testers** and **researchers** work on [**accessibility**](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/accessibility) of iOS applications.

The handbook is essentially a **complete course of digital accessibility practices with application to iOS**. **Interactive guides**, **detailed articles**, **various media assets** and **review assessments** form a holistic program with a curriculum designed such way that **everyone can find something useful**. Regardless of their current experience with the subject.

The book is consistent of 4 sections:
1. Introduction to digital accessibility 
2. Digital accessibility basics
3. Advanced accessibility practices
4. Enterprise accessibility
Each volume offers a broad range of related knowledge packed in chapters. To inspect the curriculum in detail, visit the [**Miro board**](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVKApi8PY=/?share_link_id=405322088188) overviewing the program content.

## — Who is responsible of this?
Majorly the project is based on the content of [**About Accessibility on iOS**](https://rubanov.dev/a11y-book) book written by [**Mikhail Rubanov**](https://github.com/akaDuality).

The book is exactly a **complete course** on accessibility of iOS applications, but being a traditional book — moreover available in Russian language *exclusively* — sucks. So here we are, happily putting **videos** and **code samples** on the documentation pages! Have fun.  

## — Why make it a website? 
*Websites* is an exemplary **cross-platform solution**. Having resources available on the Net widens its **availability** — one has to have nothing more than a web browser and an Internet connection to **access the resource**. 


## — How does it function?
The *interactivity* is implemented by relying on **[DocC](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/docc) technology, which is a native rich documentation solution for [Swift projects](https://www.swift.org/packages)**. It uses **[Markdown](https://apple.github.io/swift-markdown/documentation/markdown)** as its *formatting language*.

The resource is hosted by **[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)**, which is a great option **to allow anyone to contribute to the project**. **GitHub Pages simply turns a GitHub repository into a *website*, which plays along *open-source development* fittingly**. 

 
## — Can I contribute to the project? 
Yes, **everyone is welcome to influence the project**, especially considering its non-profit nature. It can be done by **committing *ideas* and *fixes* to this repository** or **straightforwardly reaching someone from the team**. A few examples of doing this:
