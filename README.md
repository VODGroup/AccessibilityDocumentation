# [AccessibilityDocumentation](https://vodgroup.github.io/AccessibilityDocumentation/documentation/accessibilitydocumentation/)

## - What is this?
At the moment this project is a vague prototype of **wrapping the already-existing documentation of [Accessibility features available in iOS SDK](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/accessibility)** in a way **to make it easier to research** available in a form of a **web-resource**. In other words our goal is to find a solution for **making plain documentation more entertaining and requiring nothing more than a web-browser**. Call it an ***education resource***.

Generally the project is dedicated to those who use the mentioned *toolkit* in their *work*: **developers**, **designers**, **researchers**. Nevertheless the content is planned that way so **one could learn Accessibility from its very *basics***. It is just not about raising *awareness*, at least for now.  

## - How is it supposed to work?

Currently our goal is to try out variable methods of documentation wrapping by implementing various **interactive solutions**, such as **step-by-step guides**, wide range of **media types** used and **[VoiceOver Designer](https://github.com/VODGroup/VoiceOverDesigner)** app prototype integration in order to find the most efficient *educational models*. 

The *interactivity* is implemented by heavy relying on **[DocC](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/docc), which is a native rich documentation solution for [Swift projects](https://www.swift.org/packages)**. It uses **[Markdown](https://apple.github.io/swift-markdown/documentation/markdown)** as its *formatting language*.

Since it is only a *prototype*, having the resource hosted by **[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)** seems to us a great option **to allow anyone to contribute to the project**. **GitHub Pages simply turns a GitHub repository into a *website*, which plays along *open-source development* fittingly**. 

## - Why make it a website? 
*Websites* is an exemplary **cross-platform solution**. Having resources available on the Net widens its **availability** - one has to have nothing more than a web browser and an Internet connection to **access the resource**.  

## - What can I find in this repository specifically?
