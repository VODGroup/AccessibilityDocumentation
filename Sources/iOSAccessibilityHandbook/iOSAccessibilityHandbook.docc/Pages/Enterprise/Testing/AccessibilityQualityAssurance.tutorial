        Testing is an essential part of production. Just as any other functionality, accessibility of an app has to be tested to make sure that the app is approachable and intuitive.

        ## Accessibility VS UX
        Accessibility Testing sometimes exposes issues of user experience nature which have nothing to do with accessibility adaption. See the tutorial below to distinguish between these kinds of bugs and know how to deal with them in accordance.

        Accessibility initiatives often come up with their vision of what makes an application accessible. Let's' go through some of the most common guidelines to see how to make your app legit.
