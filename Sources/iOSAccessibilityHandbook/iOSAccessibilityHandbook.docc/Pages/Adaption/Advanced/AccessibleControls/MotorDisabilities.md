    There are universal ways human beings
    experience the world. All people have
    motivations and build relationships. We all
    have abilities and limits to those abilities.
    Everyone experiences exclusion as they
    interact with our designs. On the other hand,
    a solution that works well for someone
    whoâ€™s blind might also benefit any person
    driving a car. Inclusive design works across
    a spectrum of related abilities, connecting
    different people in similar circumstances.
    
    Designing for people with permanent
    disabilities can seem like a significant
    constraint, but the resulting designs can
    actually benefit a much larger number of
    people. For example, closed captioning was
    created for the hard of hearing community.
    But, there are many benefits of captioning
    such as reading in a crowded airport, or,
    teaching children how to read.
    
    Similarly, high-contrast screen settings
    were initially made to benefit people with
    vision impairments. But today, many people
    benefit from high-contrast settings when
    they use a device in bright sunlight. The
    same is true for remote controls, automatic
    door openers, audiobooks, email, and much
    more. Designing with constraints in mind is
    simply designing well.
