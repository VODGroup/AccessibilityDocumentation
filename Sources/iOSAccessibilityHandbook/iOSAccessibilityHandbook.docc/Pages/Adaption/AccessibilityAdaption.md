## Why make accessible experience
Usage statistics, social surveys and other market analyses definitely show that there are people in need of assistive technology support. Despite the fact, accessibility as a field is still new. 

The answer for this question is different for every accessibility professional. There are many reasons why a product should have an accessibility adaption, but there is no requirement for any application to be approachable. Unless if your company is working for a particular government that obliges you to conform to a particular law. 

Otherwise accessibility is voluntary: only you decide why you may want to enable more people to use your product. 

iOS Accessibility Handbook project has no goal to propagate any values. If you are here it means that you have a reason to make a right thing ;)


## Accessibility API

### Accessibility is one of Apple's core values
Thanks to Apple's decision to protect diversity and invest to accessibility, it is not a unworkable ordeal to create accessible software for iOS.

Talking about iOS the system supports an impressive range of assistive technology and provides highly comprehensible documentation, including WWDC sessions, API reference and promotional materials. 

### UIKit and SwiftUI
Both of two possible user interface frameworks, UIKit and SwiftUI equally provide accessible underlayment for applications built with their use. 

Constructing an interface out of default elements majorly covers the functionality of Accessible Features, though the experience of automatically generated interface will not be as delightful as the one touched by a human. 

Having custom elements designed specifically for your interface requires a little bit more work done on supporting Accessibility Features but isn't exhausting too. 

In the book we are going to study iOS Accessibility by conceptions presents in any other interface, so it is not that important to focus on a particular framework. Nevertheless both UIKit and SwiftUI implementation are provided for every code sample.

## Adaption Strategy

Ok, enough talking. We are ready to get some work done. 

The book's guidelines are structured that way so there is some entry-level tasks to do and vast resources on polishing accessible experience.
