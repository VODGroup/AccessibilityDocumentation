## What is an interface
Scientifically talking, a **user interface** is the space between a device and its user, and contains everything that makes the communication between the human and the machine possible. 


## Elements
Any interface **provides and retrieves information**. The former ability is supposed to help the user to control the device, the latter allows this controlling.

Interfaces are built from various elements of different natures. Though all of items provide information to some degree, not all of them are used to control. Therefore elements can be separated into two groups: purely informative elements and interactive elements. 


## Connection
Any application serves a particular purpose. Even if the task an application solves is not obvious there is one and it is determined by what the application allows the user to do. To get a better grip on the concept, let's answer the "What this app is for?" question for some common types of applications.
