# DescribeContent

Operating computing devices as mobile phones can be defined by a combination of two actions: receiving output and providing output. Throughout the book we thoroughly explain the first category of actions - adapting interactions. Without allowing users communicate with devices the way that is possible and comfortable for them there is no point in considering technology at all. 

But the application we make do not only require actions from the users. They also provide information for processing. 

Operating an iPhone presumes communication between the device and its user. The phone is a source of data 


## Informational model of the world

To truly master adaption of various content a brief journey back to the primordial soup is required. You may ask: 

- How single-celled organisms are supposed to help me to better describe flowcharts for VoiceOver users?

You will see.

Being a living creature means **continuous communication with *reality***. But what exactly *is* reality? 

## Reality is a set of objects with stated properties
**Reality** as a conceptional model consisting of facts that define everything embedded in the universe. A *worldview*, which is **knowledge of the world**, is built of **perception** of these facts.

## One world - many worldviews
@Image(source: earth, alt: "")

The complexity of reality made carbon-based lifeforms diverse that much so it's hard to believe that all inhabitants of Earth share the same nature. Bacteria, insects, fish, cats, humans, corals, pine trees and mushrooms - we all are made of the same elements by the same rules and live in the same world.

Nevertheless those living creatures who are sentient, i.e. able to sense, percieve the world differently. Each species have their own knowledge of the world, their own *worldview*, defined by the set of perceptional abilities available for them. A model of cognised environment is called umwelt, and an umwelt is consistent of qualias - instances of subjective experience. 

## Senses
Subjectiveness of experience comes from the types of information species are able to recognise. It is called a perceptional system - a set of senses available for a creature.

## Sensory systems of different species
Creatures are differentiated by their evolutionary development: for example, humans and cats are of one biological class - mammals. All mammals share the same set of sensory organs. Levels of perception of a particular sense differ from a specie to specie - for example, dogs smell in a range thousands times wider than cats and moles are nearly completely blind, but in general we all are able to see, hear, touch, smell and taste. It is decided by the sensory organs developed for mammals.

## Perceptional difference within a specie
The situation is different for species of other classes, those with different sets of sensory organs. For examples, amphibians are able to sense whether their skin is wet by a completely different perception than humans. Humans decide whether they are wet or not based on the feeling of temperature difference between their skin and the environment. Frogs just feel wetness.

So perceiving the world is natural and based on the abilities of sensory system. But what if there are difference between specimen? 


## Impairments: congenital and acquired
@Image(source: color-blindness, alt: "")
It is possible to be born with a sensory system different from what is considered normal by your taxon. Sensory impairments obtained before birth are called congenital. People born with congenital impairments have no idea about types of information they are unable to perceive.

Born with normotypical but got impairment is called acquired. 

Living creatures receive information about the reality through the senses. Each species has their own set of senses that defines their experience of living. 

Humans, such as any other mammals have five senses to percieve the reality: vision, hearing, smell, touch and taste. Not every animal is able to experience life the way we do. Some animals are out of a sense familiar to us: for example, moles are blind and have no idea about what the world looks like. Other creatures are able to sense things we as humans are unable to percieve: for example, wetness. The amphibians are able to sense whether their skin is wet without referring to the temperature difference of their skin and their surroundings. Just like a presence or an absence of a particular sense every species has their own level of sensation. Dogs are able to distinguish smells better in a thousands times better than humans do. Cats don't see orange color, but hear much more than we do. 

The difference in sensing abilities is present not only between different species but among a single specie too. Each person is born with their own levels of sensational abilities and experience changes throughout their lives. Obtained impairments of sensory organs and their degeneration by aging decrease the environmental model of a person.

As living creatures we exist in the world by interacting with environment around us. Everything we know about our surroundings is built from information we perceive through the senses we have: vision, hearing, touch, smell and taste. 

The combination of perceptional options available for particular species is called umwelt. Umwelt is a perceptional model of the world. Each species has their own umwelt regardless of the fact that the world is one and only for every living creature. 

The perceptional model is built of qualia. Qualia is an instance of personalised experience. Experience is the information we recieve from the environment. Information about the world is a collection of inherent facts we are able to recognise with the set of senses we have. 

People who are disabled of a particular sense from birth have a drastically different umwelt from those who have it. If a person was born blind or color-blind will never be able to comprehend concepts of colours in purely visual terms. For non-visual people colors may be a concept only in relation to associated to specific colors properties, such as temperature of an objects. 

So talking about adaption of different types of content we should consider the fact that there are some ways of perception that are completely inaccessible for people who are disabled of the related sense. 

Talking about the data that is available for retrieval from phones there are five types of content possible: visual, audial and tactile. As for now humanity is unable to convey smells and tastes by computing technology. 

The types of content may be used exclusively or in combination with others when present in a particular media type. For example a book contains exclusively visual information, a video has both visual and audial information and a game may have all three if there is a haptic device that provides tactile output. 

So whenever we want to share experience with someone who is lacking the perception of the informational type included in this experience it is important to translate the information from the inaccessible channel to the one the person can understand. 

In this series of guides we are going to break down these three senses into ways how to tell the person who is out of its reach of the same message it consists of.
