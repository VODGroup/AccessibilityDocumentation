A quick dip back into primordial soup to understand why everyone experiences the same world differently.

## iPhone as a data transmitter
Operating a phone is essentially an exchange of data: the device provides information to be received and gets information from the user. Information transmitted by the device may take one of three forms of content types supported by the modern technology: visual, auidial and tactile. But the thing is the form of the content doesn't define the matter. The same message may be presented by various media types. A birthday postcard, balloons animation in iMessage and a voice call may represent the absolutely same experience of being congratulated. Why so?

## A deeper take on content reception

Being a living creature means **continuous communication with *reality***. But what exactly *is* reality? 

## Reality is a set of objects with stated properties
@Image(source: milky-way, alt: "")

**Reality** as a conceptional model consisting of facts that define everything embedded in the universe. A *worldview*, which is **knowledge of the world**, is built of **perception** of these facts.


## One world - many worldviews
@Image(source: earth, alt: "")

The complexity of reality made carbon-based lifeforms diverse that much so it's hard to believe that all inhabitants of Earth share the same nature. Bacteria, insects, fish, cats, humans, corals, pine trees and mushrooms - all living creatures are made of the same elements by the same rules and live in the same world.

Nevertheless those living creatures who are sentient, i.e. able to sense, perceive the world differently. Each species have their own knowledge of the world, their own *worldview*, defined by the set of perceptional abilities available for them. A model of **cognised environment** is called [**umwelt**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umwelt), and an umwelt is consistent of [**qualias**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia) - instances of **subjective experience**. 

## Experience is composite
Subjectiveness of experience comes from the types of information species are able to recognise. A set of such abilities available for a specie is called a perceptional system.

## Sensory systems of different species
@Image(source: senses, alt: "")
Creatures are differentiated by their evolutionary development: for example, humans and cats are of one biological class - mammals. 

All mammals are capable of developing the same kinds of cells for particular receptional organs. 

Levels of perception of a particular sense differ from a specie to specie - for example, dogs smell in a range thousands times wider than cats and moles are nearly completely blind, but in general all members within the taxon are able to see, hear, touch, smell and taste. It is decided by the sensory organs developed for mammals.

## Perceptional difference within a taxon
The situation is different for species of other classes, those with different sets of sensory organs.

For examples, insects are able to sense humidity by a completely different perception than humans. Humans decide whether they are wet or not based on the feeling of temperature difference between their skin and the environment. Insects just feel wetness by hygroreceptors - specific sensory cells.

## Sensory organs impairments
So perceiving the world differently is natural and based on the abilities of sensory system. But what if there are difference between specimen? 

@Image(source: vision-loss, alt: "")

It is possible to be born with a sensory system different from what is considered typic for the species as a result of disfunction of receptional cells due to prenatal pathologies. Sensory impairments obtained before birth are called congenital. People born with congenital impairments have no idea about types of information they are unable to perceive.

### Congenital

Being born with fully functional sensory system does not guarantee the integrity of perception forever. Sensory organs may be impaired during the life as a result of injury or age-caused degradation. 

### Acquired by injury

### Acquired with age
It is natural for people to hear less in a narrower range of frequencies and experience vision loss from a particular age.

As living creatures we exist in the world by interacting with environment around us. Everything we know about our surroundings is built from information we perceive through the senses we have: vision, hearing, touch, smell and taste. 

The combination of perceptional options available for particular species is called umwelt. Umwelt is a perceptional model of the world. Each species has their own umwelt regardless of the fact that the world is one and only for every living creature. 

The perceptional model is built of qualia. Qualia is an instance of personalised experience. Experience is the information we recieve from the environment. Information about the world is a collection of inherent facts we are able to recognise with the set of senses we have. 

People who are disabled of a particular sense from birth have a drastically different umwelt from those who have it. If a person was born blind or color-blind will never be able to comprehend concepts of colours in purely visual terms. For non-visual people colors may be a concept only in relation to associated to specific colors properties, such as temperature of an objects. 

So talking about adaption of different types of content we should consider the fact that there are some ways of perception that are completely inaccessible for people who are disabled of the related sense. 

Talking about the data that is available for retrieval from phones there are five types of content possible: visual, audial and tactile. As for now humanity is unable to convey smells and tastes by computing technology. 

The types of content may be used exclusively or in combination with others when present in a particular media type. For example a book contains exclusively visual information, a video has both visual and audial information and a game may have all three if there is a haptic device that provides tactile output. 

So whenever we want to share experience with someone who is lacking the perception of the informational type included in this experience it is important to translate the information from the inaccessible channel to the one the person can understand. 

In this series of guides we are going to break down these three senses into ways how to tell the person who is out of its reach of the same message it consists of.
