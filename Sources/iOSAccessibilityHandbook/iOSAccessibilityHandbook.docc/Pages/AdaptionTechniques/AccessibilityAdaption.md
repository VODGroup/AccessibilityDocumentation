Nothing here yet, but one day will be a verbose guide on how to develop accessible application with overview of actions needed to be done.

Thanks to Apple's decision to protect diversity and invest to accessibility it is not a unworkable ordeal to create accessible software for their systems. 

Talking about iOS the system supports an impressive range of assistive technology and provides highly comprehensible resources for their API. 

Both of two possible user interface frameworks, UIKit and SwiftUI equally provide accessible underlayment for applications built with their use. 

Constructing an interface out of default elements majorly covers the functionality of Accessible Features. 

Having custom elements designed specifically for your interface requires a little bit more work done on supporting Accessibility Feature but isn't exhausting too.
