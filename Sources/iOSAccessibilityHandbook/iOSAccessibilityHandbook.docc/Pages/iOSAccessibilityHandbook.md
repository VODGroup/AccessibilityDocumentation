## — What is this?

iOS Accessibility Handbook is an open-source **educational project** about making iOS applications *accessible*. Accessible application is such application that works with various *assistive technologies*, such as [**VoiceOver**](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/voiceover), [**Voice Control**](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210417) and [**Switch Control**](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201370), which enable *people with disabilities* use the application.

### Interactive Learning
This handbook provides *extended documentation* for Accessibility Features, including:
- verbose *articles* on the topic;
- interactive *guides* to follow step-by-step;
- various media.

In other words, materials here cover **everything one could ever need to know about accessibility on iOS**. 

### Target Audience
The project is dedicated to help *developers*, *designers*, *researchers* and so on — in other words, to *everyone working with accessibility* on iOS. There is **no commercial underlayment** and the only reason the project exists is to popularise the topic and to *share* relevant real-life experience of contributing *accessibility experts*.

## — How does it work? 

The handbook is somewhat of a *complete course* of **how to make iOS applications accessible** regardless of the stage of its development. The material is split into conceptual *topics* and categorised by its relation to particular assistive technologies and levels of *importance*. 

To know more about the book's structure scroll down to the bottom of the page where table of contents is.

### Technical Implementation
At the moment the project's form is defined by being a *documentation catalog* ([**DocC**](https://www.swift.org/documentation/docc)) hosted by [**GitHub pages**](https://pages.github.com). 

To contribute to the project visit its [GitHub page](https://github.com/VODGroup/AccessibilityDocumentation) and see the instruction of how one may help.

### Contributors
The resources are provided by **Mikhail Rubanov**, Head of Mobile Development at [**Dodo Brands**](https://dodobrands.io), accessibility activist and the author of ["**About Accessibility on iOS**"]( https://rubanov.dev/a11y-book) book. Exemplary and illustrative materials are based on his *working experience*.

### VoiceOver Designer
Reading the book you may sometimes notice screenshots of iOS applications with *mark-ups* related to accessibility design over them. This is [**VoiceOver Designer**](https://rubanov.dev/voice-over-designer), an [open-source](https://github.com/VODGroup/VoiceOverDesigner) macOS application that allows to design *accessibility scenarios* over a screenshot of an app.
