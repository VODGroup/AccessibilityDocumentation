An introduction to Accessibility on iOS 


## What does it mean for something to be accessible? 
Accessibility is a *property* of products (e.g. devices, services, concepts, environments) that measures **approachability** — the widest possible range of people who can use it.

Everyone has their own *preferences* and *capabilities*, therefore it is required to consider the *diversity* of products' audience if there is a wish to extend the **reach**.

There are many reasons why one would want to *include* more people — from straightforward sales increase to moral beliefs, but regardlessly of the case the strategy is the same: *to provide equal access to the same experience*.

## Computer Accessibility
Computer accessibility, often referred to as a11y, includes a wide range of solutions that are aimed to enhance approachability of computers. It may done by using assistive technology, which is specialised software or hardware, or a combination of both.

## iOS Accessibility
In this book we are going to discuss how to make iOS applications accessible. Due to the current state of technological advancement it may be narrowed to adapting your programs to the use of assistive technology, which involves nothing more than following specific design guidelines that support the usage of Accessibility Features and promote inclusivity.

### History of iOS Accessibility
[**"A Timeline of iOS Accessibility: It Started with 36 Seconds"**](https://www.macstories.net/stories/a-timeline-of-ios-accessibility-it-started-with-36-seconds/) is a marvellous research done by Shelly Brisbin that covers the path that Apple has been following to make their mobile phones accessible from the very beginning of iPhones story.

### Current State
From June 8, 2009 Apple hasn't stopped for a second to promote accessible design. [**Inclusivity**](https://www.apple.com/diversity/) is one of the core values the company has been always exposing and [**accessibility**](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/) is an immanent part of it. Aiming to make a product as universal so everyone can use it led Apple to unmeasurable promotion of assistive technology support.

To see how these technologies personalise the user experience go to the settings and play around. Please consider that turning on some features like [**Switch Control**](<doc:SwitchControl>) may be tricky to turn off, so make sure you are aware of what is going to happen when you toggle the settings.

### Community Trends
Finally, we came to the point where stating the purpose of this book is possible. iOS Accessibility Handbook is a collection of guidelines of how to develop software for iOS which supports [**Accessible Features**](<doc:AccessibilityFeatures>) and promotes [**accessible design**](<doc:AccessibleDesign>). 

To dive into the process of developing accessible application open the Table of Contents, which covers the topics discussed in the book. If you want to learn about Accessibility or assistive technology, visit other articles from General Knowledge category.
