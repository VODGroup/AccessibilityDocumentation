**Full Keyboard Access** is a feature that enables using an external physical keyboard to *fully* control an iPhone or, more commonly, an iPad.

## Motor impairments

Using a **physical keyboard** is an option to control the device for those people, who:
- have **motor impairments** but are **nonverbal** or in an **inappropriate environment** to use [**Voice Control**](<doc:VoiceControl>); 
- do not have enough **dexterity** to touch their screens but are not in need or unwilling to use [**external switches**](<doc:SwitchControl>);
- rely on using a **custom keyboard layout**; 
- *prefer* to type on a full physical keyboard.


## VoiceOver Key

There is a special **keys combination** to distinguish text input from entering **VoiceOver commands**: `Control + Option` by default or `CapsLock` if an appropriate setting was chosen. To use `CapsLock` as the **VO-key** go to Settings → Accessibility → VoiceOver → Text Input → Key modifier → Upper register.

Arrow keys work exactly like vertical and horizontal swipes: use left and right to move the focus through the elements, up and down to use custom actions.
