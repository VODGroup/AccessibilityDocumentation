AssistiveTouch is a feature that allows a user to do actions originally triggered by pressing the physical buttons of their device or performing complex gestures on the touchscreen. 

The feature is essentially an overlay with a single element that can be expanded into a menu with actions options. 

AssistiveTouch is aimed to help people who have fine motor impairments or unable to press a certain button. For example, AssistiveTouch can be used to perform all actions bind to the Side button if the button is broken or their finger doesn't reach it and its inconvenient to use.

   }
   @Column {

      }
   }
