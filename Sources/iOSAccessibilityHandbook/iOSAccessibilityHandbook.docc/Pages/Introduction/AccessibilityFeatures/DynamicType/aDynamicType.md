According to [**WHO**](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/blindness-and-visual-impairment) (**W**orld **H**ealth **O**rganisation) at least **2.2 billions people have vision impairments** that affect their **ability to see** in general.

Talking about **Dynamic Type** we are going to discuss those **visual impairments** that affect the *sharpness* of the perceived picture. To learn more about **color blindness** or **major vision loss** visit [**Colors and Shapes**](<doc:ColorsAndShapes>) tutorial and [**VoiceOver**](<doc:VoiceOver>) article accordingly.

## What Is Dynamic Type 

**Dynamic Type** is **Apple**'s technology that automatises [**scaling of fonts**](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102453).

A **font** is a family of **glyphs** of the same style used to represent **symbols** -- units of the *written* language. 

**Font scaling** is a term that describes **changing the size of symbols** both to *lesser* or *bigger* degrees. 

## Adjusting Text Size
Customisation of **text appearance** is the most common accessibility setting chosen by users of various displaying means. **Mobile devices** are more exposed to the need of font scaling support due to a relatively small size of their displays which may be found *inconvenient* for some people to interact with.

### Use Cases: Symbols Recognition

Font scaling is purposed to **enhance the visual perception** so people have better **reading experience**. According to statistics, most of the users who change the font size prefer to **enlarge** text. Which, well, sounds reasonable: **close-sight** is not only *inevitably* degrading by age, but **widely present** among vision impairments inherent to *any* age. 

### Bold Text

Not only *enlargement*, but also **bold appearance** of fonts is used to aid people **recognise symbols**. 

### Use Cases: Helping To Focus
Adjusting the size of texts can also be helpful for those people who prefer **to have lesser amount of information present on a screen**, so it is, for example, **easier to comprehend** the interface. 

## How to Support Dynamic Type

### Apple Fonts

**Dynamic Type** works well with *any* font that **supports the required scaling**. **All iOS native fonts support Dynamic Type.**

Moreover, Apple provides a powerful instrument that allows developers to scale various **glyphs**, such as **icons**: **SF Symbols** macOS application.

### Custom Fonts
To support **Dynamic Type** the appropriate **forms of a font** have to be *available* for the application. 

### Dynamic Type Enablement
To learn **how to enable your application to have scaling fonts**, see the [**appropriate tutorial**](<doc:DynamicType>.
