## Screen-Reading Technology
A screen reader is a form of [**assistive technology**](<doc:AccessibilityFeatures>) â€” a program that conveys *visual* content into *non-visual* output. It allows people who cannot visually perceive information from the screen to be able to receive it in audial or tactile forms. 

## Text-to-speech
@Row {
   @Column {
      @Image(source: "speech-output", alt: "") {
          **Audial form** comes in **synthesised speech** or **sound icons**
      }
   }
   @Column {
      @Image(source: "braille-output", alt: "") {
          **Tactile form** comes in **braille script** or **haptic feedback**
      }
   }
}
Screen readers are essential for users who...
1) have *visual disablements*, such as **blindness** or **poor eyesight**;
2) experience **dyslexia** or other *cognitive impairments*;
3) are simply in a *situation* that disables them from looking at the screen, such as driving. 

In other words, screen reading technology serves people who are *unable* to **visually** perceive information displayed on the screen.

Talking about using screen readers on *mobile* devices it brings different controls in. Navigating an interface with a screen reader on requires usage of **special gestures** on touchscreen or an external controllers of non-direct touch.
