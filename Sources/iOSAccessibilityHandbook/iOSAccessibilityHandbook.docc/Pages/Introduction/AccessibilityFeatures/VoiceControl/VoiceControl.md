Adds additional commands over graphical UI to control a phone by voice commands. A user of Voice Control can see, but can't touch their phone, as a result he can pronounce commands lite "select Pepperoni", "tap purchase" or "close screen". iPhone recognises speech, convert it to text and links command to elements' description.

Voice Control is a feature that allows to operate devices by the use of voice. 

It may be perceived as a complex case of Switch Control with a much wider range of commands possible to send.
