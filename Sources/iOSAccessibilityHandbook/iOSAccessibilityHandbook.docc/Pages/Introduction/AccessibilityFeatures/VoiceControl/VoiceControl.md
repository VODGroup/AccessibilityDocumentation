# Voice Control

Adds additional commands over graphical UI to control a phone by voice commands. A user of Voice Control can see, but can't touch their phone, as a result he can pronounce commands lite "select Pepperoni", "tap purchase" or "close screen". iPhone recognises speech, convert it to text and links command to elements' description.
