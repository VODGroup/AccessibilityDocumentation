## Meet Assistive Access
**Assistive Access** is a new [**Accessibility Feature**](<doc:AccessibilityFeatures>) presented at **WWDC23**. 

[![Alternate Text](meet-assistive-access)](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc23/10032
 "Meet Assistive Access")

The feature is purposed to provide a drastically **simplified UI of the whole system** with help of [**Dynamic Type**](<doc:DynamicType>) and fundamentally different layouts of **adapted apps** to lighten *cognitive load* for those in need.

------------------------------------------------------


## What Assistive Access is for
The feature is dedicated to enable anyone use their device **independently** regardless of how hard it is for them to use the phone in original mode. 

The technology's task is to **reduce applications functionality** to the point when the possibility that everyone can find app's interface understandable is *maximal*.

So people who have **cognitive** or **learning impairments** could easily use iPhones *on their own*. 

------------------------------------------------------

## How to enable it
1. Go to **Settings** application
2. Choose **Accessibility** category
3. Find **Assistive Access** at the bottom
4. Follow feature's **instructions**

## Principles of Assistive Access
To make an application **easy to operate** there are three directions to work on: 
- **streamlined task completion** - a possibility to go through key user scenarios without *distractions*;
- **error prevention** - absence of errors recovery that could *cognitively constrain* the user who made a mistake;
- **consistency** of the interface elements and layout - *familiarity* of interactions and patterns.

## How to adapt your app

As for today **Assistive Access** is more of a prototype than a real feature: **there is no comprehensible guidelines (and options at all) of how to *adapt* applications**.

}

Moreover, at the moment there are only **Messages**, **Calls**, **Music**, **Photos** and **Camera** native apps that are functional with the feature on.

Nevertheless, if **Apple** *decides* that they should invest their resources into proper development of the feature this page is going to turn into a complete guide of how to adapt applications for **Assistive Access**. As for now...
