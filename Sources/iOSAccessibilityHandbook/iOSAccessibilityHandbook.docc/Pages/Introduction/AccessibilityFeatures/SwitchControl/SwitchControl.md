Switch Control is a software that allows to operate with the use of external devices that take anything as an input. 

## How does Switch Control work

## Importance of accessibility adaption

## Trying out Switch Control

## Directions

Connected devices exploit the binary nature of the world and use any extrinsic signal made my users to implement interactions within the system. 

Depending on the device connected Switch Control enables using a phone with the use of breathing patterns, sounds, face recognition, muscle stretches and presses of buttons of any size and shape.  

The mechanism of Switch Control is to put a grid over visible interface and let user "touch" a specified area of the screen by sending a single when the focus is moved to desired position. 

Moving the focus may be done by the use of switches too but if there is only type of command send by the user the program will move the focus on its own so one action is enough to fully operate the device.

The grid's layout is highly dependant on the level of interface's adaption so the more an application is adapted for Accessibility Feature the easier navigating will be.
