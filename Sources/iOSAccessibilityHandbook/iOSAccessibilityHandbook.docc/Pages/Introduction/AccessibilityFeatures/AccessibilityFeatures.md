## What is Accessibility Features?
**Accessibility Features** is a collection of *software* aimed to **help people use the device**.

### Accessibility Features Are a Form of Assistive Technology
**Accessibility Features** are programmed to **personalise user experience** by adjusting the operation system's behaviour to meet users' needs and enable them to use the given device using *external* assistive technology if required.

### Assistive Technology Helps People with Disabilities
**Assistive technology** is a term that defines software, hardware and combined solutions to make life of **people with disabilities** easier. Every **Accessibility Feature** is an **assistive technology** on its own, but some features are purposed to **support external assistive technology** devices which provide alternative *input* and *output* interfaces for the system.

For example, **control devices** such as **switches** and **keyboards**, **hearing aids** and **Braille displays** are considered external because iOS devices don't have them as a part of the devices' *native functionality*.

### iOS Is Accessible from the Start
Nevertheless, most of the features that *enhance* approachability of the system do not require anything extrinsic and work **out of the box**. Excluding the possibly needed external devices, *native* accessibility functionality of the iOS devices covers a wide range of needs of users with disabilities.

In this book we're not going to take a precise look at each of them separately, but there are features that have to be thoroughly researched to understand the **accessibility of iOS** in general.

Each article above contains an overview of a feature that explains **what this feature does** and **who does it help** with directives to further investigation of **how to support it in your applications**.

## Supporting Accessibility Features in Your App

[**Accessibility Features**](<doc:AccessibilityFeatures>) use the **semantic language** of an application and change some of its *interfacial* properties to alternate the **usability** of its interface. To see how accessibility is integrated to interfaces proceed to [**Accessible Interface**](<doc:BasicTechniques>) -- the heading article of **Adapting Interfaces** volume, which is purposed to break down the **accessibility adoption** process.

Supporting a particular feature usually fully or partially enables *other* features to be used in the app, but it is important to understand the meaning of specific **accessibility attributes** of **mobile interfaces** to provide the *equal experience*. To know how *user experience* changes with various [**Accessibility Features**](<doc:AccessibilityFeatures>) used visit the [**Accessible Experience**](<doc:AdvancedTechniques>) page, which is a heading article of the detailed volume dedicated to **polishing accessible experience**.
