## What is accessibility 

**Accessibility** is a property of *things* that measures its **approachability**. Most *commonly *the term is used to refer to those qualities of objects that make them **accessible** for people with **special needs**, for example, **people with disabilities** or **users of assistive technology**.

### People with disabilities
**Disability** as a term is defined in relation to its **model**. Regardless of the focus of the model -- whether it is more *medical* or *social* -- disability is the reason of **diversity** of people's abilities in **communicating with environment**.

### Environment
Environment is *everything* around a person. In perspective of **this book**, we're going to deal with a specific type of environment: **user interfaces**. 

### User interface
User interface is everything that happens between a machine and the person using it. The communication happening between these two subjects, which is essentially an exchange of information, consists of providing output and receiving input. 

### Input and output
People provide input by interacting with the interface and receive output by perceiving the interface. Consequently, a user interface contains elements of informative (which has to be perceived), interactive (which has to be interacted with) and combined nature.

### Disability
Disabilities is something that affects the way users perceive or interact with user interfaces. 

### Users of assistive technology
To enable people with disabilities use interfaces assistive technology is used. Assistive technology are those technological solutions that are aimed to ease the life of people by providing an equitable access to the life activities. 

For example, hearing aids is a technology that helps people who have hearing impairments to hear better.

### Equity vs. equality
Notice that the word **equitable** is used instead of *equal*. It is done because demanding equal access is *delusional*: there is no equation between people. Every single person is different and have their own experience of being. 

### Inclusion
It has *nothing* to do with **human rights** and being able to **access** products of civilisation. If you don't want to *exclude* certain people **intentionally**, you should consider that everyone is **different** and **it is disrespectful to demand the same from the diverse**. 

### People with special needs
Despite the compatibility of **people with disabilities needs** and **assistive technology solutions**, users of assistive technology *cannot* be defined as people with disabilities. **There is no requirement to have a disability to use assistive technology, as well as a person with a disability may not use any of assistive technology.**

## Supporting accessibility
There may be many arguments against support of accessibility, from insufficient production resources to explicit discrimination of users of assistive technology. Unless there is no intention in exclusion of people of special needs, accessibility got a proven beneficial potential. 

### Protecting diversity
Supporting accessibility is an engine of people with disabilities inclusion. If your organisational values include such concepts as diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), accessibility cannot be omitted.

### Inclusive design
Accessibility is an aspect of inclusive design and its adoption affects the general usability of products. The more accessible the product is for minor parts of its audience, the more comfortable the user experience will be for everyone. There is no inclusivity without accessibility.

### Business profit
Moreover, accessibility of products directly benefits the business. By increasing approachability of the products their producer expands the audience (which increases profit) and provides better customer experience (which also increases profit). 

Just take a look at the studies showing that people tend to trust companies who adopt accessibility by 10% more than those who don't.

### Lawsuits safety
Even if your organisation doesn't care about accessibility, there is a chance that your government does. Sooner or later the business will be hit with a lawsuit that will make you consider accessibility unless the further loss of money and reputation is desired.

### Humanitarian intention
But most importantly, supporting accessibility is just a good thing to do. It is natural for any society to protect its members, and being a member of humanity requires you to advocate for diversity of your kind -- to make better future. And have better presence, already now.


We've just covered the key terminology of the book's subject: accessibility. 

iOS Accessibility Handbook is an educational resource dedicated to help people responsible of iOS applications to integrate accessibility into their products. 

## What's next?

### Learn and practice
Integrating digital products with accessibility is a complex and everlasting job for everyone involved in the product processes. During the course we are going to research accessibility of iOS applications in both theoretical and practical aspects, so the course content sufficiently covers everything that one has to know to make iOS apps accessible. 

### -- What is the accessibility bible?
There is no accessibility bible. Humanitarian sciences research the diversity of humanity, technological advancement brings up new ways to respect that.

But there are globally recognised guidelines that are of help to structure your work on accessibility.

### Human Interface Guidelines
First of all, there is Human Interface Guidelines. As a person related to iOS applications development, you might have already heard of this name. Human Interface Guidelines is a collection of knowledge aimed to guide people create products for Apple platforms with according to the company's values experience. (Apple is about inclusion, we've figured it out in the [**iOS Accessibility**](<doc:iOSAccessibility>) article article.)

### WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)
The keystone of digital accessibility. W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) and WAI (Web Accessibility Initiative) have been putting joint and unmeasurable efforts into international standardising of accessibility guidelines. There are the most researched and respected practices. 

### -- W is for Web. We're talking Mobile.
You're right, excuse me. WCAG2ICT is the standard we're going to take after. The thing is that as far as a user interface of a contemporary kind, it shares its everything on every platform. There are just few nuances that has to be considered talking about a particular platform. 

For example, iOS devices have the touchscreen. Every single one of them and from the very beginning of iOS history. Controlling a device with a touchscreen is a different experience than using a laptop or full-sized computer. Having a touchscreen, as an immanent part of device design, inevitably affects the design of its operational system. 

So we are talking mobile. We just greatly respect and recognise work of W3C. And not only us: people who are going to suit you in case when being unaccessible is illegal in your country are going to look at WCAG too. If there might be an accessibility bible WCAG is its draft.

### Inclusive Design Principles, Inclusive Components
Two resources talking about accessibility in light of inclusive design. Designing inclusively inevitably produces accessible products. Design with accessibility in mind and you won't ever need to refer to accessibility as to something extrinsic, and, therefore, requiring additional efforts. Shout out to Heydon Pickering. 

## Directions 
Now go learn and practice. [**Table of contents**](<doc:AdoptionGuide>) is at your service.
