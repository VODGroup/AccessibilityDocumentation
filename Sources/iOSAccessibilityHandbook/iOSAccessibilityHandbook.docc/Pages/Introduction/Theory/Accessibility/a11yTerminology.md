## What is accessibility 

**Accessibility** is a property of *things* that measures its **approachability**. Most *commonly* the term is used to refer to those qualities of objects that make them **accessible** for people with **special needs**, for example, **people with disabilities** or **users of assistive technology**.

### People with disabilities
@Image(source: microsoft-people, alt: "")
**Disability** as a term is defined in relation to its **model**. Regardless of the focus of the model -- whether it is more *medical* or *social* -- disability is the reason of **diversity** of people's abilities in **communicating with environment**.

### Environment
Environment is *everything* around a person. In perspective of **this book**, we're going to deal with a specific type of environment: **user interfaces**. 

### User interface
@Image(source: user-interface, alt: "")
User interface is *everything* that happens between a machine and the person using it. The communication happening between these two subjects, which is essentially an **exchange of information**, consists of mutual **providing output** and **receiving input**. 

### Input and output
@Image(source: input-output, alt: "")
People provide **input** by *interacting* with the interface and receive **output** by *perceiving* the interface. Consequently, a user interface contains elements of **informative** (those to be perceived), **interactive** (those to be interacted with) and **combined nature**.

### Disability
@Image(source: disabilities, alt: "")
Disabilities are *personal conditions* that affect the way users **perceive** or **interact** with user interfaces. 

### Users of assistive technology
@Image(source: assistive-technology, alt: "")
To enable **people with disabilities** use interfaces *assistive technology* is used. Assistive technology are those **technological solutions** that are aimed to *ease* the life of people by **providing an equitable access** to the life activities. 

For example, **hearing aids** is a technology that helps people who have **hearing impairments** to hear better.

### Equity vs. equality
Notice that the word **equitable** is used instead of *equal*. It is done because demanding equal access is *delusional*: there is no equation between people. 

@Image(source: equality-equity, alt: "")

**Every single person is different** and have their own experience of being that is built *not only* by their abilities and disabilities, but countless **receptive** and **processing** factors. 

### Inclusion
Accessibility is about **human rights** and being able to **access** products of civilisation. If you don't want to *exclude* certain people **intentionally**, you should embrace that everyone is **different** and **it is pointless to demand the same from the diverse**. 

### People with special needs
Despite the compatibility of **people with disabilities needs** and **assistive technology solutions**, users of assistive technology *cannot* be defined as people with disabilities. 

**There is no requirement to have a disability to use assistive technology, as well as a person with a disability may not use any of assistive technology.**

## Supporting accessibility
There may be many arguments *against* support of accessibility, from **insufficient production resources** to **explicit discrimination** of users of assistive technology. But unless there is an intention to *exclude* people with special needs, accessibility got a proven **beneficial potential**. 

### Protecting diversity
Supporting accessibility is an **engine of people with disabilities inclusion**. If your organisational values include such concepts as **d**iversity, **e**quity or **i**nclusion (**DEI**), **accessibility cannot be omitted**.

### Inclusive design
Accessibility is an aspect of [**inclusive design**](<doc:InclusiveDesign>) and its adoption affects the **general usability** of products. 

The more accessible the product is for *minor* parts of its audience, the more comfortable the user experience will be **for everyone**. **Accessibility is a well-designed (and well-developed) interfaces exclusive**.

### Business profit
@Image(source: dodo-stats, alt: "") {
    Statistics of **visual accessibility settings** of [**Dodo Pizza**](https://dodobrands.io/post/dodopizza/) users in 24 June 2023 -- 24 October 2023
}
Moreover, accessibility of products **directly benefits the business**. By increasing approachability of the products their producer **expands the audience** (which increases profit) and **provides better customer experience** (which also increases profit). 

Just inspect [**the studies**](https://instituteforpr.org/voya-ipr-disability-report) showing that **people tend to trust companies who adopt accessibility** by 10% more than those who don't.

### Lawsuits safety
@Image(source: lawsuits-stats, alt: "")
If your organisation doesn't care about accessibility, there is also a chance that your **government** does. Sooner or later the business will be hit with a **lawsuit** that is *supposed* make you consider accessibility unless the further loss of money and reputation is desired. 
> Note: Yep, "supposed" because [**it doesn't work**](https://www.lflegal.com/2018/11/webaim-fear/). But as an *accessibility professional* you have to know that there are countries in which accessibility is a **civil right**. Visit Lainey Feingold's [**Global Law and Policy**](https://www.lflegal.com/global-law-and-policy/) overview page to learn more.

### Humanitarian intention
But, most importantly, supporting accessibility is "the right thing to do" -- word-by-word quote from [**Apple's documentation**](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/iPhoneAccessibility/Accessibility_on_iPhone/Accessibility_on_iPhone.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008785-CH100-SW1). 

It is *natural* for any society to protect its members, and being a member of humanity requires you to **advocate for diversity** of your kind -- **to make better future**. And **change lives now**.

## Wrap-up

That was the **key terminology** of the book's subject -- **accessibility**.

Now we are ready to proceed with [**iOS Accessibility Handbook**](https://vodgroup.github.io/AccessibilityDocumentation/documentation/iosaccessibilityhandbook), which is an **educational resource** dedicated to *help* people responsible of **iOS applications** to **integrate accessibility** into their products. 

## What's ahead?

### Learn and practice
Integrating digital products with accessibility is a **complex** and **everlasting** job for *everyone* involved in the product processes. 

During the course we are going to research accessibility of iOS applications in both **fundamental** and **practical aspects**, so the course content sufficiently covers *everything* that one has to know to make iOS apps accessible. 

Moreover, the knowledge contained in this book is based on **universally good design practices**. Perceive the materials as *general* education on accessibility **applied to iOS apps in particular**.

## Universally good practices
Unfortunately, **there is no accessibility bible**. Humanitarian sciences research the diversity of humanity, technological advancement brings up new ways to respect that, **continuously**.

But there are **globally recognised guidelines** that are of help to *reason* your work on accessibility.

### Human Interface Guidelines
@Image(source: hig, alt: "")
First of all, there is [**Human Interface Guidelines**](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/). As a person related to **iOS applications development**, you might have already heard of this name. Human Interface Guidelines is a collection of knowledge aimed to guide people **create products for Apple platforms with accordance to the company's *vision***.

### WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)
@Image(source: wcag, alt: "")
The *keystone* of digital accessibility. [**W3C (World Wide Web Consortium)**](https://www.w3.org) and [**WAI (Web Accessibility Initiative)**](https://www.w3.org/WAI/) have been putting joint and unmeasurable efforts into **international standardising of accessibility guidelines**. 

The document states **criteria necessary for digital products to be accessible**.

### -- W is for Web. We're talking Mobile.
You're right, excuse me. [**WCAG2ICT**](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/non-web-ict/) is the standard we're going to take after. The thing is that as far as a user interface of a *contemporary* kind, **it shares its everything on every platform**. There are just **few nuances** that has to be considered talking about a **particular platform**. 

For example, iOS devices have **touchscreens**. Every single one of them and from the very beginning of iOS history. Controlling a device with a touchscreen is a **different experience** than using a laptop or full-sized computer. **Having a touchscreen, as an immanent part of device design, inevitably affects the *design* of its operational system.** 

So yes, we *are* talking mobile. We just greatly **respect** and **recognise** work of WAI. **If there might be an accessibility bible, WCAG is its draft.**

### Inclusive Design Principles, Inclusive Components
@Image(source: heydon-works, alt: "")
Two resources talking about accessibility in perspective of [**inclusive design**](<doc:InclusiveDesign>). **Designing inclusively inevitably produces accessible products.** Design with **inclusion in mind** and you won't ever need to refer to accessibility as to something *extrinsic*, and, therefore, requiring additional efforts. Shout out to [**Heydon Pickering**](https://heydonworks.com).

### Microsoft Inclusive Design
The fortress of **accessibility knowledge** acquired, applied and promoted by Microsoft. [**Inclusive 101**](https://inclusive.microsoft.design/tools-and-activities/Inclusive101Guidebook.pdf) is a *must*.

### Apple Developer Resources
Obviously, we're going to research the official [**API  documentation**](https://developer.apple.com/accessibility/) in order to *develop* accessibility. 
@Image(source: apple-developer, alt: "")


### WWDC
But, most importantly, we're interested in **WWDC (World Wide Developers Conference) sessions** labeled with **Accessibility and inclusion** category.

WWDC happens *annually*, in June, and its web resources suck. Download [**Apple Developer**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-developer/id640199958) app. Full *scripts* for each session are available.

### Apple Accessibility Support
Here are some user guides and stories about [**Accessibility Features**](<doc:AccessibilityFeatures>), which we are going to **thoroughly inspect** in order to be *fluent* with [**accessibility of iOS**](<doc:iOSAccessibility>).
@Image(source: apple-support, alt: "")

## Conclusion
Those were the **essential resources** we're going to refer to during the course. There are much more provenly great materials on **inclusion** and **accessibility**, but we're going to mention them locally to not overwhelm you at the start. **So far, have fun!**
