## What is accessibility 

**Accessibility** is a property of *things* that measures its **approachability**. Most commonly the term is used to refer to those qualities of objects that make them accessible for people with special needs, for example, people with disabilities or users of assistive technology. 

### People with disabilities
Disability as a term is defined in relation to its model. Regardless of the focus of the model -- whether it is more medical or social -- disability is a reason of diversity of people's abilities in communicating, which consist of receiving input (perception) and providing output (interaction), with their environment. 

### Users of assistive technology
Assistive technology are those technological solutions that are aimed to ease the life of people by providing an equitable access to the life activities. 

### People with special needs
Nevertheless, people with disabilities and users of assistive technology are not the same. There is requirement to have a disability to use assistive technology, as well as a person with a disability may not use any of assistive technology.

### -- So... for whom accessibility is then? 
For everyone. Accessibility is a part of universal design whose purpose is not to exclude its potential users by their differences in abilities to perceive and interact with the designed object.

### -- Ok. Just consider everyone.
No, it is impossible to include everyone. Users are essentially unknowable and it is a dangerous act to consider that anyone is able to make any predictions based on the expectations of users behaviour. But it is possible to not exclude anyone, both intentionally and unintentionally. By accessibility.

### Accessibility best practices
To make something accessible it is required to use the established means in providing equitable access for as many people as possible based on what the humanity has learned about its diversity.

### Assistive technology benefits accessibility
Assistive technology are functioning that way so their support explicitly benefits accessibility of the product.

## iOS Accessibility Book

### Accessibility of user interfaces
In this book we are going to work on accessibility of iOS application, which are programs ran on iOS devices. Computer programs is a well-discovered phenomenon and their accessibility is measured by approachability of their user interface -- space that includes every means of communication between the user and the machine. 

### Accessibility of iOS
Next, we are going to discuss accessibility of iOS and mobile devices that run this system.
