### Interfaces are just inputs and outputs
Operating a computing device is essentially an **exchange of data**: the device *provides information* to be received and *gets information* from the user.

### Multimodal Interfaces
**Information** transmitted by the device may take one of three forms of **content types** supported by the modern technology: **visual**, **auidial** and **tactile**. 

@Image(source: multimodality, alt: "") 

But the thing is the **form of the content doesn't define the matter**. The same message may be presented by various **media types**. A birthday postcard, balloons animation in iMessage and a voice call may represent the absolutely same experience of being congratulated -- they convey the same **cognitive model**. 
@Image(source: placeholder-image, alt: "") 

### Cognitive models of information
To understand why *different* **output forms** may have the same **meaning** let's research the mechanism of **perception** -- one's **ability to receive output from the outer world**.

## Reality is singular

To start with, being a living creature means **continuous communication with *reality***. But what exactly *is* reality? 

### Reality is a set of objects with stated properties

@Image(source: milky-way, alt: "") {
    *"Reality"* often refers to the **observable universe**
}

**Reality** as a conceptional model consisting of facts that define everything embedded in the universe. A *worldview*, which is **knowledge of the world**, is built of **perception** of these facts.


### One world - many worldviews

@Image(source: earth, alt: "") {
    All life lives on the same Earth
}


The complexity of reality made carbon-based lifeforms diverse that much so it's hard to believe that all inhabitants of Earth **share the same nature**. Bacteria, insects, fish, cats, humans, corals, pine trees and mushrooms - all living creatures are made of the same elements by the same rules and live **in the same world**.

@Image(source: fish, alt: "") {
    Lifeforms **diversity** is unmeasurable 
}

## Perception is plural

Nevertheless, those living creatures who are **sentient**, i.e. **able to sense**, perceive the world *differently*. Each species have their own **knowledge of the world** -- their own **worldview**, defined by the set of **perceptional abilities** available for them. A model of **cognised environment** is called [**umwelt**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umwelt), and an umwelt is consistent of [**qualias**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia) - instances of **subjective experience**. 

### Experience is composite
**Subjectiveness of experience** comes from the **types of information** species are able to **recognise**. A **set** of such abilities available for a specie is called a **perceptional system**.

@Image(source: eyes, alt: "") {
    Evolution made different eyes to see in **different conditions**
}


### Sensory systems of similar species
@Row {
   @Column {
      @Image(source: eye, alt: "") {
          Sight
      }
   }
   @Column {
      @Image(source: touch, alt: "") {
          Touch
      }
   }
   @Column {
      @Image(source: mouth, alt: "") {
          Taste
      }
   }
   @Column {
      @Image(source: ear, alt: "") {
          Sound
      }
   }
   @Column {
      @Image(source: nose, alt: "") {
          Smell
      }
   }
}

*Taxonomically* creatures are differentiated by their **evolutionary development**: for example, humans and cats are of one biological class -- **mammals** -- because these species are similar in their development.

Members of a particular **biological class** are capable of developing the same kinds of **cells** for particular **receptive organs**. Even though **humans** and **cats** perceive the reality drastically differently, their perceptions have **the same underlayment** -- but *implementation* is different. 
@Image(source: placeholder-image, alt: "")

The situation is different for species of *other* classes, those with different kinds of **receptive cells**, and, therefore, **sensory organs**. 

For examples, **insects** are able to **sense humidity** by a completely different perception than humans. Humans decide whether they are wet or not based on the feeling of temperature difference between their skin and the environment. Insects *just* feel wetness -- by *hygroreceptors* - specific **sensory cells**. 
@Image(source: butterfly, alt: "") {
    It knows it is wet
}

It is not required to be of a different specie to have different cognitive model of the world: *levels* of perception of a particular sense differ from a specie to specie. Dogs smell in a range thousands times wider than cats and moles are nearly completely blind, but as mammals they **all are able to see, hear, touch, smell and taste -- just to different degrees**.

## Sensory organs impairments
Now we know that **perceiving the world differently is natural** and based on the **capabilities** of one's **sensory system**. But what about difference unrelated to **biological diversity**? Why members of the **exact same species** may perceive the world *so* differently?

### Congenital impairments
It is possible to be born with a sensory system capabilities different from what is considered **typic** for the species as a result of **disfunction of receptive cells** due to *prenatal* pathologies. Such **sensory impairments** obtained *before* birth are called **congenital**.

@Image(source: newborn-albino, alt: "") {
    Albinism often comes with **congenital visual disability**
}

> Important: People who **were born** without an ability to use a particular sense, for example, those who are *congenitally* completely **blind** or **deaf** have no idea about visual or audial forms of information in the terms of how sighted or hearing people perceive it. **Their cognitive *image* of the world are different.**

### Obtained impairments
Being born with **fully functional sensory system does not guarantee the integrity of perception forever**. Typical perception may be adjusted **temporary** or **permanently** during the life as a result of **changes within the receptive or processing organs**. 

@Image(source: eye-injury, alt: "") {
    An injured eye is a **dysfunctional sensory organ**
}

@Image(source: magnifying-glass, alt: "") {
    It is natural for people to experience **vision loss** from **aging-related degradation of sensory organs**
    }
    
## -- Ok. How does this all information helps me create accessible products? 
The *most* important point that can be taken from this page (after the fact that no one is safe from losing abilities to sense, of course) is that **the meaning behind any cause is the same regardless of its interpretation**. 
    
@Image(source: placeholder-image, alt: "")
    
    
For example, a mobile applications implementing pizza delivery solves the same task **with** and **without** graphic interface **available to be perceived**. The **experience** of making an order will be different, but the **mental model** of the process is the same for everyone. Because it was *designed* this way. 

As *accessibility experts* it is our **goal** to create interfaces that are **perceivable in different conditions**, i.e. have the **content** as independent as possible of its **form**.
