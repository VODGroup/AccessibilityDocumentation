# ``AccessibilityDocumentation``

Accessibility part of UIKit and SwiftUI frameworks helps developers to represent graphical user interface for assistive technologies

## Overview


- **VoiceOver** helps blind or low-visioned persons to use a phone by listening audio description of UI and command by different swipes and non-direct touches.

- **Voice Control** adds additional commands over graphical UI to control a phone by voice commands. A user of VoiceControl can see, but can't touch their phone.

- **Switch Control** allows to connect external devices and link them to any command. As a result paralyzed people can control a phone by simple signals: finger movement, muscle stretches, etc. Also, a phone's camera can recognize facial expression or any sound like a command.

To prototype interaction on early stage of development you can use [VoiceOver Designer](https://rubanov.dev/voice-over-designer/) application for macOS.
